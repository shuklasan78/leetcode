##The word ‘cryptography’ was coined by combining two Greek words, ‘Krypto’ meaning hidden and ‘graphene’ meaning writing.
## Steganography : people not only want to protect the secrecy of an information by concealing it, but they also want to make sure any unauthorized person gets no evidence that the information even exists.
## Security Services of Cryptography
  - Confidentiality : It is a security service that keeps the information from an unauthorized person. It is sometimes referred to as privacy or secrecy.
  - Data Integrity : t is security service that deals with identifying any alteration to the data.Data integrity cannot prevent the alteration of data, but provides a means for detecting whether data has been manipulated in an unauthorized manner.
  - Authentication : It confirms to the receiver that the data received has been sent only by an identified and verified sender.Authentication service has two variants −
       * Message authentication identifies the originator of the message without any regard router or system that has sent the message.
       * Entity authentication is assurance that data has been received from a specific entity, say a particular website.
  - Non-repudiation : It is a security service that ensures that an entity cannot refuse the ownership of a previous commitment or an action. It is an assurance that the original creator of the data cannot deny the creation or transmission of the said data to a recipient or third party.Non-repudiation is a property that is most desirable in situations where there are chances of a dispute over the exchange of data. For example, once an order is placed electronically, a purchaser cannot deny the purchase order, if non-repudiation service was enabled in this transaction. 
## Cryptography Primitives
  - Cryptography primitives are nothing but the tools and techniques in Cryptography that can be selectively used to provide a set of desired security services.
    * Encryption
    * Hash functions
    * Message Authentication codes (MAC)
    * Digital Signatures
